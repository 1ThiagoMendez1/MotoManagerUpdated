- Background color: Light Gray (#F5F5F5), nearly white, to create a clean and modern interface.
- Accent color: Yellow-Orange (#FFAB40), a more saturated hue which contrasts well with blue, to highlight key actions and notifications.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective look, good for both headings and body text.
- Use simple and clear icons from a consistent icon set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent different sections and actions.
- Employ a card-based layout to organize information.  Ensure clear visual hierarchy with consistent spacing and alignment.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and feedback (e.g., button presses, form submissions).
